# Design Decisions:

## Database : Why NoSQL?

- we picked NoSQL because of its own access languages to interpret data being saved, rather than using a relational model.
- It has developer-centric database, makes designing of databases and  access to application programming interfaces easier. 
- Developers need not be bothered by inner workings of databases before using them.
- NoSQL databases, gives the flexibility to work on what is required rather than forcing the schema on the database.

## Database : Why MongoDB ?


- Mongo db supports multiple hierarchy of data. 
- Allows flexibility in Datamodel because of the secondary indexes. 
- Mongo DB is schemaless and hence we not define the schema in the start. 

## Rest Over GraphQL
- Managing errors is easier using Rest as Graphql sends 200 OK code irrespective of the errors processed.
- GraphQL limits MongoDB's Flexible schema with its fixed schema. 

## Why MERN Stack
- Performance and UI rendering
When it comes to UI layer abstraction, React JS is the finest. Because React is merely a library, you may construct the application and organize the code anyway you wish. As a result, it outperforms Angular in terms of UI rendering and speed.

- Budget-Friendly
Because MERN Stack employs only one language throughout, Javascript, it will be advantageous for a corporation to recruit only Javascript experts rather than specialists for each technology. This decision will save both time and money.

- Free and Open Source
All of the technologies used in MERN are open-source. This feature enables a developer to obtain answers to issues that may arise during development from the accessible open sources.

## Hosting to Amazon EC2  with Load Balancer 
- Easy web scale computing : application can automatically scale itself up and down depending on its needs based on the web API's written
- RELIABLE: Amazon EC2 offers a highly reliable environment where replacement instances can be rapidly and predictably commissioned. 
- INEXPENSIVE Amazon EC2 passes on to you the financial benefits of Amazonâ€™s scale. You pay a very low rate for the compute capacity you actually consume.
It technically free for student developers deploying smaller applications.
